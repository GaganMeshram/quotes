Quotes Project
This is a simple web application that displays famous quotes from historical figures, authors, and other influential people. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the Quotes API to fetch a random quote and display it on the page.

How to use
To use the Quotes project, simply open the live demo in your web browser. The page will display a random quote along with the name of the author. You can click the "New Quote" button to generate a new quote.

If you like a particular quote, you can share it on Twitter by clicking the "Tweet" button. This will open a new window with a pre-filled tweet that includes the quote and author.
