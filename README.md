<h1>Quotes Project</h1>

    <p>This is a simple web application that displays famous quotes from historical figures, authors, and other influential people. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the <a href="https://type.fit/api/quotes">Quotes API</a> to fetch a random quote and display it on the page.</p>
    
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>To use the Quotes project, simply open the <a href="https://gaganmeshram.github.io/quotes/quotes">live demo</a> in your web browser. The page will display a random quote along with the name of the author. You can click the "New Quote" button to generate a new quote.</p>
    <p>If you like a particular quote, you can share it on Twitter by clicking the "Tweet" button. This will open a new window with a pre-filled tweet that includes the quote and author.</p>
